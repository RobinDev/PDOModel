PDOModel extends the default PHP PDO Class possibility
================================================

PDOModel is a simple class to set up a database and their tables and then... maintain the data easily. Some Features : function `edit` replace `insert` or `update`, oriented to execute a lot of insert/edit (see massEdit,massInsert...), composer friendly (and available on [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/ropendev/pdomodel)).
